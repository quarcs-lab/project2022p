# Instructions and tips for using the template working paper of the QuaRCS-lab


## Figures

- Upload your figures to the figures folder

- I suggest using the following code snippet to add figures into the manuscript

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%START%FIGURE%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{figure}[h]

\begin{center}
  \includegraphics[width=0.80\textwidth]{figures/YOURFIGURE.png}
\end{center}

\caption{ADDcapitonHERE}  
\label{fig:ADDlableHERE}

\vspace{1mm}

\textbf{
	\textit{\scriptsize{}Notes:}}
	{\scriptsize{}
	  ADDyourNotesHERE
	  }{\scriptsize\par}

\end{figure}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%END%FIGURE%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%


## Tables

- You can copy your tables from excel and paste them in  https://www.tablesgenerator.com/ to translate those tables into latex. Another suitable option could be https://tableconvert.com

- I suggest using the following code snippet to add tables into the manuscript


%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%START%TABLE%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{table}[h]
\caption{ADDcaptionHERE}
\label{tab:ADDlabelHERE}

\small
\begin{center}

ADDtabularEnvironmentHERE


\end{center}

\vspace{1mm}

\begin{tablenotes}[para,flushleft]
  \footnotesize 
  Notes: Add notes here.
 \end{tablenotes}

\end{table}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%END%TABLE%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

## Equations and Math

- You can use Matpix (https://mathpix.com/) to scan equations and paste them directly into the manuscript. 


## References

- You can use Mendeley to export bibtex references, and paste them in the references.bib file
