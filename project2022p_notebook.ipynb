        "Nighttime lights (NTL) data are widely recognized as a useful proxy for monitoring national, subnational, and supranational economic activity. These data offer advantages over traditional economic indicators such as GDP, including greater spatial granularity, timeliness, lower cost, and comparability between regions regardless of statistical capacity or political interference. However, despite these benefits, the use of NTL data in regional science has been limited. This is in part due to the lack of accessible methods for processing and analyzing satellite images. To address this issue, this paper presents a user-friendly geocomputational notebook that illustrates how to process and analyze satellite NTL images. First, the notebook introduces a cloud-based Python environment for visualizing, analyzing, and transforming raster satellite images into tabular data. Next, it presents interactive tools to explore the space-time patterns of the tabulated data. Finally, it describes methods for evaluating the usefulness of NTL data in terms of their cross-sectional predictions, time-series predictions, and regional inequality dynamics.\n",

        "## 1. Introduction\n",
        "\n",
        "Nighttime lights (NTL) data have become a widely recognized proxy to monitor economic activity at the national, subnational, and supranational levels (Chen, Nordhaus, 2011; Henderson et al., 2012; Sutton et al., 2007). The use of NTL data can offer considerable advantages over traditional economic indicators, such as GDP. For example, NTL data provide greater spatial granularity, are more timely, and are less costly to construct than GDP. Furthermore, NTL data are comparable between multiple regions, regardless of differences in statistical capacity, political interference, or informal activities.\n",
        "\n",
        "Despite their potential benefits, the latest NTL data products (Elvidge et al., 2017; Li et al., 2020; Rom ÃÅan et al., 2018) have had limited use in the regional science literature. One plausible reason for this limitation is the lack of accessible methods for processing and analyzing satellite images. Specifically, the processing of large raster-based satellite images into tabular data has made it difficult for researchers to use the latest satellite data products. To address this issue, we introduce a geocomputational notebook that provides a step-by-step guide on how to process and analyze recent satellite NTL images.\n",
        "\n",
        "The notebook begins by introducing a cloud-based Python environment for visualizing and transforming raster images into tabular data. The notebook then presents interactive tools to explore the space-time patterns of the tabulated data. These tools allow researchers to better understand both the spatial distribution and the temporal trends of NTL data. To develop a sense of the informational content of NTL, the space-time patterns of GDP are also presented. Finally, the notebook illustrates methods for evaluating the usefulness of NTL data in terms of cross-sectional predictions, time-series predictions, and regional inequality dynamics."

        "Modern computational notebooks allow us to present code in conjunction with descriptive text, equations, visualizations, and tables in a single document (Rowe et al., 2020). The use of such notebooks greatly enhances the reproducibility and transparency of scientific research. Although computational notebooks are a step forward, a major bottleneck remains in the reproducibility of the computational environment that is used to produce research results. Especially for geospatial analysis, a notebook user still needs to download, install, and manage numerous computational libraries and their dependencies.\n",

As subnational GDP data are available at the state level, we need to aggregate the NTL values accordingly.

The `explore()` function of the Geopandas package allows us to easily construct interactive maps. In addition, consistent with the `Mapclassify` package, multiple classification schemes are available. For example, in Figures 2 and 3, we use a boxplot classification to understand the spatial distribution of NTL and GDP in 2013. We can easily identify where the regions below and above the median are located. In addition, we can identify and compare the spatial clusters of both distributions. Although there are large similarities in these two variables, their spatial classification is not identical. For example, the region of Madhya Pradesh, which is located in the center of India, is classified in the highest quantile in terms of its luminosity, but it is below the 75th percentile in terms of GDP."

In the code below, we use the previously constructed dataframe (`df`), which contains both NTL and GDP data. After indicating the `x` and `y` variables, we only need to use the argument `color` to identify the regions. After generating the `Plotly` object, to save the results as a static image, we can also use the `write_image( )` method.

        "Figure 8 shows a strong linear relationship between (log) NTL and GDP. In the year 2013, NTL explained 91 percent of the regional variation in GDP. Over time, however, the predictive power of NTL has decreased. By 2019, NTL explained 81 percent of regional GDP. The regression coefficient of NTL in 2013 was 0.82, indicating that a ten percent increase in NTL is associated with an 8.2 percent increase in GDP. Over time, this coefficient has slightly increased. By 2019, a ten percent increase in NTL is associated with an 8.6 percent increase in GDP. Taken together, these results indicate that, on a year-by-year basis, nighttime lights are a useful proxy for economic activity.\n",

        "To evaluate the usefulness of nighttime lights (NTL) for predicting economic activity (GDP), let us consider the following panel-data model:\n",
        "\n",
        "$\\log (GDP)_{it} =  \\beta \\log (NTL)_{it} + \\mu_i + \\varphi_t + \\varepsilon_{it}, $ (1)\n",

        "where $i$ indexes the regional economies,  $t$ indexes the years, $\\mu_i$ is a region-specific  effect,  $\\varphi_t$ is a year-specific effect, and $\\varepsilon_{it}$ is the term of random disturbance. Region specific effects, $\\mu_i$, capture the influence of unobserved factors that are constant over time. Time specific effects, $\\varphi_t$, capture the influence of unobserved factors that change over time but are common between regions. The most important parameter in this model is $\\beta$, which summarizes the relation between GDP and nighttime lights (NTL). Given the logarithmic specification of the model, the parameter $\\beta$ indicates by what percentage GDP changes when the NTL changes by 1\\%. However, the specification of Equation 1 does not imply that NTL causes GDP. The parameter $\\beta$ only has a predictive interpretation.\n",
        "\n",
        "There are multiple ways to estimate the parameter $\\beta$. Let us consider the following three basic cases:\n",
        "\n",
        "$\\log (GDP)_{it} =  \\beta_{\\text{Pooled}} \\log (NTL)_{it} + \\mu + \\varepsilon_{it}, $ (2)\n",
        "\n",
        "$\\overline{\\log (GDP)_{i}}  =  \\beta_{\\text{Between}} \\overline{\\log (NTL)_{i}} + \\mu_i + \\overline{\\varepsilon_{i}},\n",
        "$ (3)\n",
        "\n",
        "$\\log (GDP)_{it} - \\overline{\\log (GDP)_{i}} =  \\beta_{\\text{Within}} \\left[\\log (NTL)_{it} - \\overline{\\log (NTL)_{i}} \\right] + \\varphi_t + \\varepsilon_{it} - \\overline{\\varepsilon_{i}}, $ (4)\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "The simplest estimation of $\\beta$ is based on the so-called \"pooled\" estimator, $\\beta_{\\text{Pooled}}$. In this setting (Equation 2), time-specific effects are set to zero and all regions share a common intercept $\\mu$. The parameter $\\beta_{\\text{Pooled}}$ indicates that--for all regional observations--an increase in NTL of 1\\% leads to a $\\beta_{\\text{Pooled}}$ \\% expected increase in GDP. This model implies that we can expect the same effect of NTL on GDP if there is a 1\\% difference between regions or a 1\\% increase within a region. Thus, an important limitation of Equation 2 is that we cannot disentangle the usefulness of NTL data to predict cross-sectional differences or time series changes in GDP.\n",
        "\n",
        "The \"between\" and \"within\" estimators are commonly used to evaluate the usefulness of NTL data for predicting GDP differences and changes within regions, respectively (Gibson, Boe-Gibson, 2021; Zhang, Gibson, 2022). In Equation 3, the (log) values of GDP and NTL are time averaged, and the model is estimated using standard cross-sectional methods. The parameter $\\beta_{\\text{Between}}$ indicates the effect on GDP when NTL changes between regions. In Equation 4, Equation 3 is subtracted from Equation 1, and, by doing so, unobservable region-specific effects ($\\mu_i$) are removed from the estimation.\n",
        "The parameter $\\beta_{\\text{Within}}$ indicates the effect on GDP when NTL changes within regions.\n",
        "\n",
        "The Linearmodels package allows us to estimate a variety of panel-data models. We can easily compare the previously described estimations. Consistent with the previous literature (Gibson, Boe-Gibson, 2021; Zhang, Gibson, 2022), the results of Table 7 show that the predictive capabilities of NTL vary greatly depending on the type of data structure. The results of the \"between estimator\" are encouraging in terms of statistical significance and predictive power. NTL data predict about 86\\% of the variation in GDP data. The regression coefficient indicates that a 10\\% increase in NTL is associated with an 8.87\\% increase in GDP. In contrast, the results of the \"within estimator\" do not show a statistically significant relationship between NTL and GDP. Based on these results, nighttime lights are better at predicting cross-sectional differences than changes in time series."

Specifically, Figure 10 shows that the inequality in NTL was 1.74 times higher than the inequality in GDP in 2013. By 2019, this inequality ratio has been reduced to 1.45.

This paper presented a user-friendly notebook for analyzing satellite NTL images in a cloud-based Python environment. When using these data, one needs to carefully explore space-time patterns, as NTL may require additional cleaning and processing. When using NTL data to predict economic activity, one must note the difference between cross-sectional and time-series predictions. NTL data has been shown to perform much better with the former. Another application worth exploring is the measurement of regional inequality dynamics. Using multiple inequality measures is recommended to confirm regional inequality trends."

First, we want to apply the `mask` function from `rasterio` to return a matrix corresponding to a raster file, which has `nodata` at all locations outside the polygons of the states.\n",

For this, we create a wrapper function called `geom_mask`, which calls `mask` and passes the additional arguments.

        "The second keyword argument, `all_touched = True` tells the mask function to include pixels which are touching boundaries. If false, the function will include a pixel only if its center is within the boundaries, or if it is selected by Bresenham (1965) line algorithm. For most polygons in our case, `all_touched = False` will produce similar results. The difference would be noticeable for states that contain islands.\n",
